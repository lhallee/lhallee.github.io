## Introduction

**Hi, I’m [@lhallee](https://github.com/lhallee)!**  

My name is Logan Hallee, a scientist working on computational protein modeling through the lens of machine learning. Most notably, I am the the Chief Scientific Officer and Founder of Synthyra, a Public Benefit LLC which functions as a research org for protein science. I am also a PhD Candidate in Bioinformatics at the University of Delaware in the ([Gleghorn Lab](https://www.gleghornlab.com/)), where my research is focused on (you guessed it) protein modeling with transformer neural networks. On the side I run a fun blog called [Minds and Molecules](https://medium.com/minds-and-molecules) which touches on philosophical ideas I find facinating.

### You can find my CV [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q4mQotGm7MyU-TLmf_x17bRxalCy_Fcz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110410923518282620159&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Research Highlights

### SYNTERACT
- [**SYNTERACT**](https://huggingface.co/GleghornLab/SYNTERACT) is a large language model for protein–protein interaction prediction.
- First LLM approach to PPI.
- Ranks in the [**top 3% of research outputs**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.07.544109v1.article-metrics) by Altmetric.  

### Tetris For Proteins
- Collaborated with **Stephen Wolfram** & other mentors at the Wolfram Winter School.  
- Developed “[Tetris For Proteins](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2777595)” – a shape-based metric emulating lock-and-key enzyme-substrate interactions.  
- Generates hypotheses on protein aggregation likelihood.

### Annotation Vocabulary
- Invented the [**Annotation Vocabulary**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.30.605924v1.abstract), a unique set of integers mapped to popular protein and gene ontologies.  
- Enables state-of-the-art protein annotation and generation models when paired with its own token embedding.

### Codon Usage Bias
- Codon usage bias is highlighted as a key biological phenomenon and valuable feature for machine learning in [Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28965-7).  
- Our models show codon usage with a powerful phylogenetic association  
- Introduced [**cdsBERT**](https://huggingface.co/GleghornLab/cdsBERT), showcasing cost-effective ways to enhance biological relevance in protein language models via a codon vocabulary.

### Mixture of Experts Extension
- Invented a [Mixture of Experts extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15713) for scalable transformer networks adept at sentence similarity tasks.  
- Future networks with N experts could perform like N independently trained networks, offering significant time and computational savings in semantic retrieval systems.
- In review.

### Computer Vision in Biology
- Collaborates on lab projects involving deep learning for reconstructing 3D organs from 2D Z-stacks.  
- Informs morphometric and pharmacokinetic studies to further understanding of organ structure and function.
